# Project Status

## Current Changes
- Fixed handling of copilot-instructions.md and repo-specific prompts
  - Base repo now properly gets copilot-instructions.md
  - Each repo gets its own specific prompt file
  - Removed redundant try() statements in copilot module locals
  - Improved null handling in file generation logic

## File Changes Made
1. modules/copilot/locals.tf:
   - Simplified null checking in files local
   - Improved repository_files map structure
   - Fixed how copilot instructions are handled for base vs non-base repos

2. repository_files.tf:
   - Using correct output name (generated_instructions) from copilot module
   - Fixed handling of copilot instructions file for base repo only
   - Properly generating repo-specific prompts

## Current State
- Base repository correctly gets:
  - .github/copilot-instructions.md
  - All module files
  - Project-level prompt
  - Standard files
  - Workspace config files

- Project repositories each get:
  - Their own specific .github/prompts/{repo-name}.prompt.md file
  - Standard files
  - No copilot instructions file (as intended)

## Known Issues
None currently identified. All files are properly formatted and error-free.

## Next Steps
1. Test the changes with real repositories to verify:
   - Base repo gets copilot instructions
   - Each repo gets its specific prompt
   - No duplicate files are created
2. Consider adding validation to ensure:
   - Base repo is properly identified
   - All prompts are valid markdown
   - No empty prompt files are created
