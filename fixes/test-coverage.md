## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure Tests

1. Project Configuration Tests
   ```hcl
   run "project_configuration" {
     variables {
       project_name = "test-multi-repo"
       repositories = [
         {
           name = "service-a"
           dependencies = ["service-b"]
         },
         {
           name = "service-b"
           dependencies = []
         }
       ]
     }
     assertions for:
     - Repository creation order
     - Dependency graph validation
     - Cross-repository references
   }
   ```

2. Project Settings Inheritance Tests
   ```hcl
   run "settings_inheritance" {
     variables {
       base_settings = {
         visibility = "public"
         default_branch = "main"
       }
       repository_overrides = {
         "service-a" = {
           visibility = "private"
         }
       }
     }
     assertions for:
     - Base setting application
     - Override precedence
     - Invalid override detection
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Security Testing

1. Access Control Tests
   ```hcl
   run "access_control_validation" {
     variables {
       github_pro_enabled = false
       repositories = [{
         name = "test-repo"
         teams = {
           admins = ["team-a"]
           maintainers = ["team-b"]
         }
       }]
     }
     assertions for:
     - Team permission application
     - Free tier limitations
     - Invalid permission combinations
   }
   ```

2. Branch Protection Tests
   ```hcl
   run "branch_protection_rules" {
     variables {
       enforce_prs = true
       required_reviews = 2
       branch_pattern = "release/*"
     }
     assertions for:
     - PR requirement enforcement
     - Review count validation
     - Branch pattern matching
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Pattern Tests

1. Template Validation Tests
   ```hcl
   run "infrastructure_templates" {
     variables {
       workflow_templates = ["ci.yml", "cd.yml"]
       environment_configs = ["dev", "prod"]
     }
     assertions for:
     - Template file creation
     - Variable substitution
     - Environment configuration
   }
   ```

2. CI/CD Configuration Tests
   ```hcl
   run "cicd_configuration" {
     variables {
       pipeline_type = "containerized"
       build_requirements = ["docker"]
     }
     assertions for:
     - Pipeline file structure
     - Build requirement validation
     - Configuration compatibility
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Compliance Tests

1. Required Files Tests
   ```hcl
   run "compliance_files" {
     variables {
       required_files = [
         "LICENSE",
         "SECURITY.md",
         "CONTRIBUTING.md"
       ]
     }
     assertions for:
     - File presence
     - Content validation
     - Template application
   }
   ```

2. Code Analysis Configuration Tests
   ```hcl
   run "code_analysis" {
     variables {
       analysis_tools = ["codeql", "dependabot"]
       language_specific = {
         python = ["pylint"]
         javascript = ["eslint"]
       }
     }
     assertions for:
     - Tool configuration
     - Language-specific rules
     - Analysis workflow creation
   }
   ```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Test Independence
   - Each test should be self-contained
   - Use mocks for external GitHub API calls
   - Clean up test resources after execution

2. GitHub Free Tier Compatibility
   - All tests must pass without GitHub Pro features
   - Skip tests that require Pro features
   - Provide alternative test paths for Free tier

3. Mock Configuration
   - Use consistent mock responses
   - Document mock requirements
   - Handle API rate limiting in mocks

4. Assertions
   - Test both positive and negative cases
   - Validate error messages
   - Check resource attributes thoroughly

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize test implementation based on:
   - Current coverage gaps
   - Feature criticality
   - Dependency order

2. Create test fixtures:
   - Mock data files
   - Template repositories
   - Test configurations

3. Implement continuous testing:
   - Add to CI pipeline
   - Automate test execution
   - Track coverage metrics
