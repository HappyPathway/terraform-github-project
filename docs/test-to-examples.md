# Test to Examples Transition Plan

## Overview
The terraform-github-project module will move from traditional test files to working examples based on patterns found in the github-projects workspace. This ensures real-world validation and removes dependency on GitHub Pro features.

## Current Working Examples Found
The github-projects workspace contains several successful implementations:
- gcp-kubernetes project with multiple submodules
- morpheus-workspace infrastructure modules
- All examples demonstrate public repository patterns that work without GitHub Pro

## Transition Strategy

### 1. Example Structure
Each example should demonstrate:
- Proper variable setup (project_prompt, repo_org, project_name)
- Public repository configuration
- Working file generation without GitHub Pro features
- Valid repository structures

### 2. Required Example Types
1. **Minimal Example**
   - Single repository
   - Basic configuration
   - No optional features

2. **Multi-Repository Example**
   - Base repository + multiple project repositories
   - Demonstrates repository relationships
   - Shows workspace configuration

3. **Infrastructure Example**
   - Based on gcp-kubernetes pattern
   - Shows module organization
   - Demonstrates repository grouping

### 3. Example Requirements
Each example must:
- Include terraform.tfvars with required variables
- Avoid GitHub Pro features
- Be completely self-contained
- Include README with usage instructions
- Have proper validation in CI/CD

### 4. Implementation Steps
1. Create examples/ directory structure:
   ```
   examples/
   ├── minimal/
   ├── multi-repo/
   └── infrastructure/
   ```

2. Port working configurations from:
   - github-projects/gcp-kubernetes
   - github-projects/morpheus-workspace

3. Remove test files that:
   - Require GitHub Pro
   - Have incomplete variable configurations
   - Don't represent real-world usage

### 5. CI/CD Updates
- Update GitHub Actions to test examples
- Remove existing test workflow
- Add example-specific validation
- Test public repository creation
- Verify file generation

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Update README.md to reflect example-based testing
- Document each example's purpose and usage
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Add migration guides for existing users

## Benefits
- Real-world validation
- No GitHub Pro dependencies
- Clearer usage examples
- Better documentation
- More maintainable tests

## Timeline
1. Create example directory structure
2. Port working configurations
3. Update CI/CD
4. Update documentation
5. Remove old tests
6. Validate and release
